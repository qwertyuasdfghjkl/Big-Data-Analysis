# Question 1  
## 1 a)
```{r}
housingData <- read.csv('_data_hw2/housingprice.csv')
head(housingData)
# coverting zipcode column into factors
housingData$zipcode <- as.factor(housingData$zipcode)
```


Finding the most expensive zipcodes:  
```{r}
avgPrice <- tapply(housingData$price, housingData$zipcode, mean)
avgPrice <- sort(avgPrice, decreasing = TRUE)
avgPrice[1:3]
```
The top 3 zipcodes whose housing prices are the most expensive is 98039, 98004, and 98040  

Boxplots of housing prices for these 3 zipcodes:
```{r}
plot1 = subset(housingData, zipcode == 98039, select = c(price))
plot2 = subset(housingData, zipcode == 98004, select = c(price))
plot3 = subset(housingData, zipcode == 98040, select = c(price))

boxplot(plot1)
boxplot(plot2)
boxplot(plot3)
```
Above is the boxplots of the housing prices for the most expensive 3 zipcodes.

## 1 b). Scatter plot  
```{r}
plot(housingData$sqft_living, housingData$price, main="relationship between sqft and price",
   xlab="sqft living", ylab="price", pch=20)
```
above is a scatterplot showing the relationship between sqft and price.

# Question 2.  

## 2 a).  


# Question 3. Wine Pricing  
## 3 Part I. Preliminary Analysis  

```{r}
wineData <- read.csv('_data_hw2/wine.csv')
head(wineData)
```
```{r}
plot(wineData$AGST, wineData$Price, main="relationship between AGST and price",
   xlab="average growing season temperature (AGST)", ylab="price", pch=20)
plot(wineData$WinterRain, wineData$Price, main="relationship between winterRain and price",
   xlab="winter rain amount", ylab="price", pch=20)
plot(wineData$HarvestRain, wineData$Price, main="relationship between harvest rain and price",
   xlab="Harvest rain amount", ylab="price", pch=20)
plot(wineData$Age, wineData$Price, main="relationship between age and price",
   xlab="age of wine", ylab="price", pch=20)
```
The variable that looks to be the most correlated with Price would be AGST. The scatter plot looks the most patterned and we see that generally, the price increases as AGST increases, an upwards trend.
```{r}
AGST <- cor.test(wineData$AGST, wineData$Price, 
                    method = "pearson")
winterRain <- cor.test(wineData$WinterRain, wineData$Price, 
                    method = "pearson")
harvestRain <- cor.test(wineData$HarvestRain, wineData$Price, 
                    method = "pearson")
ageWine <- cor.test(wineData$Age, wineData$Price, 
                    method = "pearson")
AGST
winterRain
harvestRain
ageWine
```
As we can see from the pearson's correlation scores above, the cor of 0.6596 for AGST is the highest correlation between a variable and price. This backs up our claim before that AGST is the most correlated with price.  

## 3. Part II. Marginal Regression Analysis  
```{r}

# install.packages("rlang")
library(rlang)
```

```{r}
#install.packages('ggplot2')
library(ggplot2)
#install.packages('sjPlot')
library(sjPlot)
```

```{r}
fit <- lm(Price ~ AGST, data = wineData)
plot_model(fit, type = "pred")
summary(fit)
```
The fitted coefficient values is -3.4178 and 0.6351. The intercept is -3.4178 and for every 1 unit increase in AGST, price increases by 0.6351. The Rsquared value is 0.435.

## 3. Part III. Multiple Regression Analysis
```{r}
multi_fit2 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain, data = wineData)
summary(multi_fit2)
multi_fit3 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age, data = wineData)
summary(multi_fit3)
multi_fit4 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain, data = wineData)
summary(multi_fit4)
multi_fit5 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain + FrancePop, data = wineData)
summary(multi_fit5)
```
As we add more covriates, we find that R squared on the training data increases. Which generally could mean that the model is fitted better. We find that at 1 variable, Rsquared = 0.435, increasing to 0.7074, 0.79, 0.8286, and finally 0.8294 at 5 covariates. The model that we choose based on Rsquared is Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain + FrancePop since the Rsquared is the highest. Note: sometimes having a high Rsquared does not lead to a better model.

```{r}
winetestData <- read.csv('_data_hw2/winetest.csv')
head(winetestData)
```
```{r}
testfit <- lm(Price ~ AGST, data = winetestData)
summary(testfit)
testmulti_fit2 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain, data = winetestData)
summary(testmulti_fit2)
testmulti_fit3 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age, data = winetestData)
summary(testmulti_fit3)
testmulti_fit4 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain, data = winetestData)
summary(testmulti_fit4)
testmulti_fit5 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain + FrancePop, data = winetestData)
summary(testmulti_fit5)
```
From the winetest data provided, since all of the variables is collinear to AGST, adding covariates does not change the Rsquared and the coefficient values. Also there is only 2 data entries. The Rsquared value for each model is equal to 1. The model that we choose based on Rsquared is Price ~ AGST since all of the variables are collinear.
```{r}
multi_fit5 = lm(Price ~ AGST + HarvestRain + Age + WinterRain + FrancePop, data = wineData)
summary(multi_fit5)
```
As seen above, we can see that rains in the winter followed by hot summer (high AGST) both has a positive relation with price. However the hot summer affects the price of the wine a lot more than the rain in the winter. Rainfall at harvest also has a negative relation with price. If we take that the price reflects the quality of wine, then Prof. Ashenfelter's findings is consistent with our model.
